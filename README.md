# Age and Gender Detection using Deep Learning

This project predicts **age** and **gender** from facial images using deep learning models such as **VGG16** and **ResNet** with **transfer learning**. It is based on the **Adience Benchmark Dataset** and demonstrates how CNNs can accurately classify gender and estimate age groups even under challenging lighting and pose conditions.
